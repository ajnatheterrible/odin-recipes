    <h2><i>This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe.</i></h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 recipe pastry for a 9 inch double crust pie</li>
        <li>½ cup unsalted butter</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>¼ cup water</li>
        <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>½ cup packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>8 Granny Smith apples - peeled, cored and sliced </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce temperature and let simmer.</li>
        <li>Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly. Cover with a lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so that it does not run off.</li>
        <li>Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.</li>
    </ol>
